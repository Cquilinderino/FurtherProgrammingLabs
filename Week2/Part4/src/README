Extend the account class to create a new subclass called CAccount for modelling a checking
account, with the following features:
A. Checking accounts can use an overdraft facility, so the new class will need instance
variables for the overdraft limit and the amount overdrawn.
B. The overdraft should not be used unless the current balance is insufficient to cover a
withdrawal.
C. When funds are deposited and there is an overdrawn amount, the funds should be used
to reduce the overdrawn amount to 0 before the balance can be increased. For example,
if overdrawn amount is $200, when $500 is deposited, overdrawn amount should be
reset to 0, and the remaining amount $300 should be added to balance setting it at $300.
D. A new constructor will be required that accepts the account name, ID, initial balance
and overdraft limit. This constructor should use the super() facility to initialise the
account ID, name and balance. This constructor should set the amount overdrawn to 0.
E. Both withdraw and deposit methods must be overridden to accommodate these
requirements.
F. Create a CAccount object and invoke withdraw and deposit methods in TestAccount
class.
