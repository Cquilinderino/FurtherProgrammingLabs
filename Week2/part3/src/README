The following program was written to model a bank account that allows customers to withdraw and deposit funds.
A. Identify all design and syntax errors in the program below (there are at least 5).
B. Modify the withdraw method so that it tracks the number of withdrawals done, checks whether there is sufficient balance or not, and returns a boolean indicating the withdrawal succeeds or fails.
C. Add another method to add interest based on the current interest rate supplied.

public class Account {
    private String name;
    private String ID;
    //private this balance
    public double balance;

    //Remove void from constructor
    public void Account(String name, String ID, double balance) {
        //Add this. keyword behind these variables
        name = name;
        ID = ID;
        balance = balance;
    }

    //remove void, needs a return type of double
    public void getBalance() {
        //return this.
        return balance;
    }
    public void withdraw(double amt) {
        balance -= amt;
    }
    public void deposit(double amt) {
        balance += amt;
    }
}

public class TestAccount {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Account a1 = new Account("Tan A K", "S123", 24.5);
        Account a2 = new Account("Smith T", "S124", 1200.0);
        a1.deposit(100);
        a1.withdraw(2000);
        a2.deposit(120);
        a2.withdraw(80);
        //a1/a2.name won't work, need getter method
        System.out.println("Balance for " + a1.name + " is " + a1.getBalance());
        System.out.println("Balance for " + a2.name + " is " + a2.getBalance());
    }
